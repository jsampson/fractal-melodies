/ exit after playing
/ reversing pattern
/ generate MIDI sequence and play that, rather than calling noteOn/noteOff directly
/ play pattern once right before song
/ pull all magic numbers into song variables (scale, tempo, etc.)
    / pattern (lengths, pitch offsets, reversals)
    / start
    / bottom
    / scale
    / tempo
/ text format for songs
/ harmonies
/ command line
    / play named song
    / save named song as .mid
- support multiple harmonies
- allow +N for pitch offsets
- validate everything
- figure out why songs end "abruptly" (subjectively/musically speaking)
- do we need multiple MIDI channels? trick is that note on/off events name the
  "key" that was pressed, so we either need multiple channels or some code to
  merge them together such that if bass and treble both want to press the same
  key they don't conflict
- progress bar while playing
x make MIDI tick resolution exact
