/ exit after playing
/ reversing pattern
/ generate MIDI sequence and play that, rather than calling noteOn/noteOff directly
/ play pattern once right before song
/ pull all magic numbers into song variables (scale, tempo, etc.)
    / pattern (lengths, pitch offsets, reversals)
    / start
    / bottom
    / scale
    / tempo
- text format for songs
    - validation of everything
- harmonies
    - do we need multiple MIDI channels? trick is that note on/off events name the
      "key" that was pressed, so we either need multiple channels or some code to
      merge them together such that if bass and treble both want to press the same
      key they don't conflict
- progress bar while playing
- make MIDI tick resolution exact
- Swing UI
- output/save as .mid
- figure out why songs end "abruptly" (subjectively/musically speaking)
