/ exit after playing
/ reversing pattern
/ generate MIDI sequence and play that, rather than calling noteOn/noteOff directly
/ play pattern once right before song
/ pull all magic numbers into song variables (scale, tempo, etc.)
    / pattern (lengths, pitch offsets, reversals)
    / start
    / bottom
    / scale
    / tempo
/ text format for songs
/ harmonies
/ command line
    / play named song
    / save named song as .mid
/ support multiple harmonies
x make MIDI tick resolution exact
/ allow +N for pitch offsets
/ do we need multiple MIDI channels? trick is that note on/off events name the
  "key" that was pressed, so we either need multiple channels or some code to
  merge them together such that if bass and treble both want to press the same
  key they don't conflict
/ support outputting to an actual MIDI device
/ error if song is not piano-safe (any notes outside 21-108)
/ progress bar while playing
- validate everything nicely
    - show friendly error message with line number
    - general line syntax
    - value line before first name line
    - unrecognized type
    - unrecognized value
    - missing or too many of any singular value
    - for scale:
        - middle must be an integer from 0 to 127
        - steps must be a non-empty, strictly-increasing list of integers > 0
    - for song:
        - scale must be already defined
        - notes must be a non-empty list with valid note syntax
        - note lengths must add up to 1 (ignoring "-" for reversal)
        - start must have valid note syntax
        - bottom must have valid fraction syntax and be positive
        - beats must have valid fraction syntax and be positive
        - each harmony must have valid note syntax and positive length
    - note syntax:
        - require non-zero length
        - allow + or - but not both
    - in main:
        - file not found etc. for songs (input) and .mid (output) files
        - no such song in file
        - notes in sequence outside of piano range 
- documentation
    - file format reference
    - article about background, algorithm, and examples
- GUI
    - file chooser for songs file
    - plain text editor for songs file
        - when file is saved, re-parse it and select line if any errors
    - help, including file format and theory
    - drop-down to choose song
        - maintain original capitalization of song names
        - show note range of resulting sequence
        - show warning if outside of piano range (21-108)
        - show error if outside of MIDI range (0-127)
    - buttons for play and save
    - drop-down to select MIDI device or software synth for playing
    - file chooser for saving .mid file
    - add a rating attribute to each song to remember how good they are
- allow multiple patterns, chosen randomly (weighted?) on each recursion
    - can it be non-random? does it matter?
    - maybe allow specifying seed, so that good runs can be reproduced
    - what about harmonies? seems they should use the same pattern at the
      same point in the song -- only difference is how deep they go
- figure out why songs end "abruptly" (subjectively/musically speaking)
- come up with a way to incorporate silence (rests)
