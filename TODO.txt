/ exit after playing
/ reversing pattern
/ generate MIDI sequence and play that, rather than calling noteOn/noteOff directly
/ play pattern once right before song
/ pull all magic numbers into song variables (scale, tempo, etc.)
    / pattern (lengths, pitch offsets, reversals)
    / start
    / bottom
    / scale
    / tempo
/ text format for songs
/ harmonies
/ command line
    / play named song
    / save named song as .mid
/ support multiple harmonies
x make MIDI tick resolution exact
/ allow +N for pitch offsets
/ do we need multiple MIDI channels? trick is that note on/off events name the
  "key" that was pressed, so we either need multiple channels or some code to
  merge them together such that if bass and treble both want to press the same
  key they don't conflict
/ support outputting to an actual MIDI device
- warn if output file is not piano-safe (any notes outside 21-108)
- validate everything
- progress bar while playing
- documentation
    - file format reference
    - article about background, algorithm, and examples
- allow multiple patterns, chosen randomly (weighted?) on each recursion
    - can it be non-random? does it matter?
    - maybe allow specifying seed, so that good runs can be reproduced
    - what about harmonies? seems they should use the same pattern at the
      same point in the song -- only difference is how deep they go
- figure out why songs end "abruptly" (subjectively/musically speaking)
